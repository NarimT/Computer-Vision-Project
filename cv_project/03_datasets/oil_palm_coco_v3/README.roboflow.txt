The dataset includes 632 images.
Palm-tree are annotated in COCO format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 512x512 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 10 versions of each source image:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise
